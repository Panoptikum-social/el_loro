This app needs permission to record your spoken (spanish) audio, it tries to recognize it
using Google's Speech to Text service. That means that your voice data is transferred to Google's
server.

The app does not store that data, it also does not transmit it to any other third party
than Google. The app does not analyse or track any usage behaviour.

So Google's privacy policy applies for data transferred to them, that is your voice data:
